# Dependencies

- Python 3 (Tested on 3.11)
- Poetry

## TODO: create a requirements.txt file. It will be available in future updates.

To download the dependencies run:

'''bash
poetry install
'''

After the installation a virual environment should be created, either in the Poetry venvs folder or in the project root directoy (it depends on your setup). To use IDE tools or Jupiter NB, just select the virtual environment created before as interpreter.
